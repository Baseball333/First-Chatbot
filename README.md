# First-Chatbot
This repository is the source code for my first chatbot. Note that I have not implemented this project in my CLI or on a GUI. The source code was written from a Medium article and hosted here for my own pleasure. Shoutout to Jere Xu, I'll fork his repo as well.

First Commit:
The description was quite vague, so I'll spare some of the viewers of this repository. When I was attempting to find a basic chatbot whose code I were to analyze and implement on my operating system's command line (Bash on Debian) I found Xu's Medium article. As I read his code and description of the chatbot's functionality I was intrigued to uploading the code on a repository as my own project. The code will be publicated in my own repository to record 2020's programming progress. I will still fork Xu's repository although I executed my separate implementation of the chatbot.

Second Commit:
Now that the nature of the project has been established, the functionality of the code is to be described. As Xu mentioned in the Medium article this repository is divided into nine files. More on this tomorrow.
